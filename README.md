This repository contains LaTeX sources of my dissertation on "A structurally-parametrical identification of implantable rotary blood pumps in ventricular assist devices".

The contribution of this research is in development of algorithm of system identification allowing to build specific mathematical models of implantable rotary blood pumps (RBPs) for ventricular assist devices. The results also include a method for identification of pumping states in RBPs and a control algorithm for RBPs developed on the basis of investigation of cardiovascular system and RBPs interaction.
